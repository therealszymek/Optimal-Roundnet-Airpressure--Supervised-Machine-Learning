# Optimal Roundnet Airpressure: Supervised Machine Learning
 The goal of this algorithm is to use data from circumstance fair serves between friends and variables to develop a regression model to observe the relationship between air pressure and distance from safety distance (assuming fair serve rule is in place), to predict what would the fairest air pressure for the roundnet ball.
