# Optimal Roundnet Airpressure: Supervised Machine Learning
The goal of this algorithm is to use data from circumstance fair serves between friends and variables to develop a regression model to observe the relationship between air pressure and distance from safety distance (assuming fair serve rule is in place), to predict what would the fairest air pressure for the roundnet ball.

This algorithm revolves around the fair serve rule, which is a cultural rule that describes a serve from a legal positions where the rebound of the ball can be picked up fairly by the other team, which is ideally the safety distance line.

The definition of safety distance is the mean between the highest and lowest rebound distances allowed in roundnet games. The highest rebound distance is based on the average shoulder height of my friend group (127 cm), while the lowest point is determined by the height the ball should reach when dropped from 1.5 meters (which is 50.8 cm).
